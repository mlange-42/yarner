# Plugins

Plugins allow further functionality to be provided for Yarner. A plugin is an external executable that is called by Yarner during the build process, and that receives and returns the parsed documents in JSON format.

The following sections explain [how to use](./using.md) and [how to write](./writing.md) plugins.

Further, a list of [known plugins](./known.md) is provided.
