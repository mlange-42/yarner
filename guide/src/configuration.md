# Configuration

All aspects of Yarner's syntax and most of its behaviour cen be configured in the project's `Yarner.toml` file. The file is structured into sections `parser`, `paths`, and potentially multiple `language` sections. These sections are explained individually in the following chapters.

Some options can be overwitten by command line arguments. See chapter [Command line arguments](./command-line-arguments.md) for details.
