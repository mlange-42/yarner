# Pre-processors

Pre-processors allow further functionality to be provided for Yarner. A pre-processor is an external executable that is called by Yarner during the build process, and that receives and returns the parsed documents in JSON format.

The following sections explain [how to use](./using.md) and [how to write](./writing.md) pre-processors.

Further, a list of [known pre-processors](./known.md) is provided.
