# How is works

From one or more source files written in Markdown, Yarner extracts compilable or executable code from code blocks and generates a cleaned-up Markdown documentation.

Code and documentation are written to separate folders. By default, these are the sub-folders `code` and `docs` of the project directory.

When using more advanced features, documentation looks different compared to the Markdown sources, but with the basic features both will be equal and sources can be used as documentation directly.
