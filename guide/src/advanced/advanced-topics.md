[[_TOC_]]

This part of the guide provides more advanced information for effective work with
Yarner, and with Markdown in general.

Chapter [**Continuous integration**](./continuous-integration.md) demonstrates how
to automate Yarner using different CIs (GitLab, GitHub Actions, GitHub Travis-CI).

Chapter [**Project structure**](./project-structure.md) presents some typical
project layouts for different Yarner use cases.

Chapter [**Effective Markdown**](./effective-markdown.md) provides a list
of tools for Markdown, as well as some tips how to use Markdown effectively.

Chapter [**mdBook with Yarner**](./mdbook.md) shows how to use Yarner in conjunction
with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to write good-looking Literate Programming documents
(the book you are currently reading was created with mdBook).

Chapter [**The ODD protocol**](./odd-protocol.md) explains how the
[ODD protocol](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=40429) can be combined with
Yarner to use Literate Programming for the development and documentation of
(individual-based) simulation models.
