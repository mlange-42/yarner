## File(s) to include in code output (unprocessed), as glob pattern(s).
# code_files = ["**/*.rs"]
## Allows to modify paths of copied code files. Replaces path components. Optional.
## When given, must have as many elements as code_files.
## E.g., use "foo/bar" to replace the first two path component by foo and bar.
## Use "." to ommit, and "*" to preserve a component. Use "" if no change is intended at all.
# code_paths = ["."]
## File(s) to include in docs output (unprocessed), as glob pattern(s).
# doc_files = ["**/*.png", "**/*.jpg"]
## Entrypoint block name. Optional. If not supplied, unnamed code blocks are used.

## Language-sprcific settings. Optional. Required for reverse mode.
## The language is determined by the extension of code output files.
## Example language settings for Rust:
# [language.rs]
## Start of comments. Can be start of line or block comments.
# comment_start = "//"
### End of comments. Optional, only for block comments
## comment_end = "*/"
## Start of block labels.
# block_start = "<@"
## End of block labels.
# block_end = "@>"
## Replaces lines containing only whitespaces by blank lines, in code output. Defaults to true.
# clear_blank_lines = true
## Enforces code files to always end with a blank line. Defaults to true.
# eof_newline = true
