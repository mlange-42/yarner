For a simple Rust project, we only need to ignore folder `target`:

```
//- Main
/target/
```

We need to name this code block, because we have set option `entrypoint` in the `Yarner.toml` in order to avoid writing the blocks to the code output that show the Yarner commands in [README.md](README.md).
