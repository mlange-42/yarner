# Rust/Markdown LP example

**Content**

* [Project setup](Cargo.toml.md)
* [Git ignore file](.gitignore.md)
* [Main function](src/main.rs.md)

The content of the generated project's `README.md` will look like this (un-rendered, of course):

```md
# Readme, generated by `outline`

All code in this folder and subfolders, including this readme,
`Cargo.toml` and `.gitignore` were created using literal programming.

You find the documentation from which the code and all other files were derived from
here: [../README.md.md](../README.md.md).
```
