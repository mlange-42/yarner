# Yarner feature demo

This examples demonstrates Yarner's most important features by creating a simple but complete [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) project.

See file [README.md.md](README.md.md) for the sources used by Yarner.

Generated code files are located in sub-directory [`code`](code), while the generated documentation can be found in [`docs`](docs).

To re-generate files, simply run the following command in the current directory:

```
> yarner
```
